# Python-ExcelCleansing

As I was going through my list of projects on Trello board, I discovered a card in my backlog with the title "Data Cleansing - Excel multiple sheets". That card somehow reminded me about an article named "10 Python Skills They Don't Teach in Bootcamp" that I just read this morning. What a better way to give it a try!

The dataset contains the US Monthly Retail Trade Report downloaded from the US Census Bureau website. It was an Excel file containing multiple sheets. Each sheet includes monthly sales of a specific year between 1992 and 2020.

Since the tabular format for the year 2020 is slightly different from data between 1992 and 2019, I have split the original Excel file into 2 separate files for separate processing.
